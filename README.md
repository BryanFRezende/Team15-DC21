# UMD Data Challenge 2021 (DC21):
### Data Exploration to Cultivate Better Living

### What is this repository?
This repository is a fork from the original repository uploaded as my team's official GitHub final submission for completion of the data challenge ([original can be found here](https://github.com/cmytelka/Team15-DC21)). It includes most of the work our team produced during the week the challenge took place—Saturday, February 20 to Saturday, February 27 of 2021. I created this fork to describe the challenge, my team's work, and my contributions in more depth. I also added some files not included in the original repository.

### What is the UMD Data Challenge?
The UMD Data Challenge is a one-week competition hosted by the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies where students analyze a dataset of their choice to find valuable information and form recommendations useful to the organizations which provided the data. Teams are composed of 1-4 students ranging from undergraduates to PhD candidates. After a week of analysis and preparation, students present their results through 15-minute slideshow presentations to several panels of judges composed of professionals and academics in data science. Awards are given to teams based on how well they fulfilled the criteria established in the given rubric. Winners briefly present their results to a live audience and answer questions from the host—this year (2021), via live-stream online. More information can be found at the [iSchool's Data Challenge website](https://datachallenge.ischool.umd.edu/).

### Which dataset did we work on?
My team chose to analyze dataset **\#5. VeoRide E-scooter Transportation** for the *UMD Department of Transportation Services (DOTS)* The prompt from the Data Challenge website for this dataset:

*The company that provides the e-scooter service in the UMD area, VeoRide Inc., is a mobility service provider that manages their micro mobility fleet through the use of the Mobility Data Standard (MDS). Data generated from individual e-scooters and stored in VeoRide’s computers contain the information necessary for this study. The dataset comprises 62 days (October 2020 and October 2019) of historical data, to include ride counts, event times, trips, routes, and status changes. The Department of Transportation Services would like to know how the publicly available e-scooter service available on campus provided by VeoRide Inc., supplements the campus transportation network. Within the timeframe of the data, there are 14 variables and 40,325 rows of recorded rides.*

### What did my team accomplish during DC21?
We provided DOTS with valuable information from the VeoRide scooter data given to us. We learned about unique Python libraries essential to data science and analysis. We formed a strong team and found interesting trends within our analysis. We presented several excellent presentations and were awarded *Best Team Presentation*. We tied with another team (so I suppose you could say we won *1 of 2 of The Best Team Presentations*), but we were still ecstatic to be 1 of 9 winners among the 42 teams. I gave a brief talk on our results to the live-streamed audience, which can be found [here on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Zqz0G1V74Us?t=2884).

### How did we achieve our results?
The reasons we succeeded in receiving an award were because we played as a team, we dedicated time to our analysis every day of the competition week, and we were genuinely interested and excited to participate in the challenge. Our goal was never to win an award, in fact we were shocked when we did, but our goal *was* to test our abilities, learn more about data processing, and have fun while doing it. It was clearly a good strategy.

Well before the challenge started, we had a couple of team meetings to introduce ourselves to each other and get oriented. We took that time to learn about each other's personalities, strengths, and skills so we could be prepared to work effectively as soon as the challenge started.

Every competition day held a myriad of tasks waiting to get done. Our strategy was to meet for a few hours everyday and diligently finish those tasks little by little. By the end of the week, we wrapped up our results and presentation slides with time to practice several runs.

At the end of the day, stress kills. So, we had fun, we made jokes, and we enjoyed each other's company. Not to say things never got tense, but rather we managed the pressure of a tight schedule and loads of work by fostering an atmosphere of friendliness and compassion.

### Why did I participate in DC21?
I chose to participate this year for a couple of reasons. For one, it was my first year back to college and wanted to test my analytical skills as I work towards a career in Physics or Data Science. It was also a way for me to see how much I enjoy data analysis—kind of like a test drive. It was only a week but it was intensive and I think, overall, it was helpful as I decide in which direction I want to focus my studies.

### What did I contribute to *Team 15*?
Luckily, I've developed many skills over the years and many of them came in handy during the challenge. Here are some of the contributions I found to be of greatest impact to my team's analysis and presentation of results.

* Giving presentations is one of my favorite responsibilities on any team and I let it shine during the challenge. Being concise while conveying all the important information is an art I truly enjoy. By focusing on the key takeaways of our analysis and distilling our findings it into compelling explanations, I formed many parts of my team's core recommendations presented to the judges.

* Time management was key during the competition week and I strategized our time allocation accordingly. Helping my teammates recognize where time might be best spent helped save us dedicate precious hours and minutes to the most important tasks.

* Excel is definitely a strong suit of mine, so I was able to quickly crunch some numbers early in the challenge and arrange them in a way that gave our team enough understanding of the dataset to help guide our following moves.

* Python was *not* a strength of mine as of the start of the challenge, but with my resourcefulness I was able to provide some insights on that front despite my limited knowledge. One example of that was finding code to connect our Google Drives to the script so that the dataset could be accessed from the Colab Notebook being used to generate information.

* A sense of camaraderie and morale are such an important elements in every team which is why I made sure to actively listen and treat my teammates with respect. It might seem like something that should *go without saying*, but it should always be consciously implemented in team environments. The human capital of a team is unmeasurable and I think that belief resonated with my teammates in a way that helped us manage our tension during a stressful challenge.
